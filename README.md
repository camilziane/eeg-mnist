# EEG-MNIST: Reproducing Brain Signal Models

Welcome to **EEG-MNIST**, a project aiming to reproduce the results of top-performing models on brain signal datasets as showcased in the [Hugging Face MindBigData Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/DavidVivancos/MindBigData-Leaderboard).

We are currently focusing on implementing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a foundational step before moving on to more advanced approaches. This project explores brain EEG models and datasets provided by **David Vivancos**, particularly the:¬†**MindBigData 2022: A Large Dataset of Brain Signals**

## üß† Project Overview

This project is built to validate and test EEG models from peer-reviewed papers. For now, the implementations include:

1. **CNN-based model** from [Sensors (2023)](https://doi.org/10.3390/s23239351)
2. **SPENet** from [Neurocomputing (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2024.127654)

While faithfully replicating the papers, our results currently fall short of their claimed performance (13‚Äì15% accuracy compared to >80%). This discrepancy might stem from:

- Potential misunderstandings of the papers.
- Preprocessing differences.

Our goal is to identify these gaps and refine the implementations to match or exceed the reported results.

## üì¶ Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

### 1. Clone and Sync the Project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/camilziane/eeg-mnist.git
cd eeg-mnist
uv sync
```

### 2. Explore and Test Implementations

Open the `main.ipynb` notebook to test the models implemented so far:

- CNN-based model
- SPENet

Run the cells to load the dataset, preprocess the data, and evaluate the models.

## üìÑ Datasets

### MindBigData 2022 & 2023

The EEG-MNIST dataset was created by **David Vivancos** as part of the **MindBigData** initiative. These datasets are among the largest and most detailed publicly available collections of brain signals.

## üö† Future Directions

This project is an ongoing exploration of EEG-based modeling. Upcoming steps include:

- Refining CNN implementations for higher accuracy.
- Incorporating advanced techniques such as transformer-based architectures.
- Scaling to **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** models on the leaderboard.
